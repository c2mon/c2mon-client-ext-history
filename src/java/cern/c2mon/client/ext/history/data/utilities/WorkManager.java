 * This class is used to keep track of elements that are currently being worked
 * on. This class supports multithreading as all calls are thread safe.
 * 
 * Example of the logic: 
 * 1. You add a list of elements that you want to
 * start to work on. All the elements in the parameter is returned
 * 2. You add another list of elements that you want to start
 * to work on, but returns only the tags which is not already being worked on.
 * 3. You unregister the tags you are finish working on.
